## 01  |  Overview

### Project Scenario
Capstone project for [Front-End Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer). Little Lemon has faced difficulties with the reserve-a-table feature on its website. Currently users need to call the restaurant to make reservations and this process leaves customers and employees frustrated. Additionally, the feature doesnâ€™t exist in the navigation bar and there is no specific button on it's homepage to highlight the option.

### What is Little Lemon?
Little Lemon is a fictional restaurant located in Chicago. They pride themselves on their tasty, wholistic, and healthy food and their commitment to using technology to elevate their customers' dining experience.

### Project Goal
Design and develop a new form to book a reservation online. In addition, the homepage needed to be built and the UI/UX cleaned up from the mockups provided.
